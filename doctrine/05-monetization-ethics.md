# Monetization Ethics Doctrine

Atrest must succeed as a profitable business. A beautiful free product nobody pays for
is not ethical — it's dead. This doctrine defines how the business sustains itself
with integrity: clear about what costs money, honest about why, and never manipulative.

---

## Principles

Monetization must never rely on:
- Urgency, countdown timers, or "limited time" language
- Fear of loss or aesthetic degradation as punishment
- Artificial scarcity or social proof pressure ("78% of users chose…")
- Guilt, shame, or language implying the user owes something
- Dark patterns of any kind — including gentle or gradual ones

Monetization may rely on:
- **Positive desire** — the user experienced depth and wants to keep it
- **Ownership** — a permanent relationship with the app at a fair price
- **Gratitude** — the app was a good companion; supporting it feels natural
- **Honest value** — the premium experience is genuinely richer in ways the user has felt

## The Three Phases of the User Journey

### Phase 1: Full Experience Trial (Fasts 1–10)

For the first 10 completed fasts, every user gets the complete Atrest experience:
- Full timer with biological milestone companion text
- Tree materialization on every fast (all 8 variants, full dusk palette)
- Forest with every completed tree placed and visible
- Full calendar with all session history
- Water tracking
- Stars, arrival animations, time-of-day sky — everything

**No indication that this is a trial.** No counter ("fast 3 of 10"). No banner.
No "trial" label anywhere in the UI. The user simply uses the full product.

At a typical 16:8 or 18:6 pattern this gives 2–3 weeks of real relationship
with the tree, the forest, the arrival moment. Long enough to feel it.
Long enough to miss it if it's gone.

### Phase 2: The Transition Moment (After Fast 10)

After the 10th completed fast, before the user starts their 11th, the app presents
a **single, beautifully designed full-screen moment**. This appears once.

**Visual treatment:**
- Full-screen frosted glass overlay on the dusk sky background
- Centered content, generous white space, the Atrest tree glyph at the top
- Earth palette typography — warm, quiet, not urgent
- Two action options at the bottom, equal visual weight

**Copy (directional — final wording will be refined):**

> You've completed 10 fasts with Atrest.
>
> The timer, milestones, water tracking, and your recent history
> are always yours — no charge, no conditions, no expiry.
>
> The tree, the forest, and your full history are part of the
> deeper experience. If Atrest has been a good companion to your
> practice, you can keep it all.

Then, below — two clear options:

> **Continue with Atrest** — $29/year
> One-time purchase available: $79
>
> **Maybe later**

**Behavior of "Maybe later":**
- Dismisses the overlay immediately. No guilt. No confirmation dialog.
- The user proceeds to the free tier. The transition moment does not reappear
  unprompted. A quiet "Go premium" option lives in Settings for when they're ready.

**Behavior of "Continue with Atrest":**
- Opens the premium purchase surface (see Paywall section below).

**What this moment must NOT include:**
- A list of features being "taken away"
- A comparison table (free vs premium)
- Any urgency language
- Any countdown or time limit
- Any reference to what the user will "lose"
- A "not now" button — the wording is "maybe later" (softer, no rejection framing)

### Phase 3A: The Free Tier (Post-Trial)

The free tier is **a real product, not a stripped punishment.**

**What free users keep — permanently, unconditionally:**

| Element | Free Tier Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Timer** | Full functionality. Start, stop, abandon. All biological milestone companion text. Every phase description. No restrictions. |
| **Timer screen atmosphere** | The dusk palette background. Subtle gradient. The free tier still *feels* like Atrest — warm, atmospheric, contemplative. Not flat, not clinical, not grey. |
| **Biological milestones** | All six phases with full companion-toned descriptions. Identical to premium. Knowledge is never paywalled. |
| **Water tracking** | Full functionality. Add, view today's entries, delete. No restrictions. |
| **Recent history** | The last 10 completed fasting days visible in calendar view. Older entries exist in storage but are not displayed. |
| **Settings** | Full access to all settings, data export, data import. |
| **Navigation** | Same navigation as premium (contextual: immersive during fast, floating icons during idle). |

**What free users do NOT have:**

| Element | Free Tier Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Tree materialization** | The tree does not appear on the timer screen during a fast. The screen shows the timer, milestones, water — all in the atmospheric dusk palette — but without the progressive tree visual. The space where the tree would be is simply the sky. |
| **Forest** | Not accessible. The forest navigation icon is not shown. The user knows the forest exists from the trial — but it's not dangled or teased. It's simply absent. |
| **Full calendar** | Calendar shows the most recent 10 fasting days. There is no "locked" section, no greyed-out entries, no "upgrade to see more." The calendar simply shows what it shows. Older history is invisible, not visibly withheld. |
| **Stars/arrival animation** | These are elements of the tree experience and do not appear independently. |

**The critical distinction:**
The free tier does not *degrade*. It does not *fade*. The user does not watch beauty drain away.
The trial gave them a preview of the full depth. The free tier is what free always was —
functional, warm, dignified, but without the visual depth layer. The emotional framing is
"I know what more looks like, and I can choose it" — never "I lost something beautiful."

### Phase 3B: The Premium Tier

**What premium unlocks — immediately and permanently (annual) or forever (lifetime):**

| Element | Premium Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Tree materialization** | Full progressive materialization on every fast. All 8 variants. Dual-axis emergence (opacity + color temperature). The core visual relationship. |
| **Forest** | Accessible. Every completed fast places a tree. Perpetual dusk sky, parallax star layer, depth-layered layout. The accumulated visual history. |
| **Stars** | 4-pointed star at tree completion, releases to forest sky. |
| **Arrival animation** | Full animation sequence when a fast completes. |
| **Full calendar** | All fasting history, unlimited. |
| **Future: Depth layer** | When built — the optional Christian reflections toggle. Premium only. |

## Pricing

| Option | Price | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Annual** | $29/year | Renews each year at displayed price. Cancel anytime via App Store. |
| **Lifetime** | $79 once | One-time purchase. Permanent access. Never expires. |

**Presentation rules:**
- Both options are shown with equal visual weight. No "most popular" badge. No "best value" highlight.
- Prices are displayed plainly. No crossed-out "original price." No percentage savings.
- Annual shows "per year" not "per month" — do not divide to make it seem smaller.
- Lifetime shows the one-time price with "forever" or "one-time."
- Apple handles the transaction. This is stated clearly: "Purchases handled by Apple. No accounts, no tracking."

## The Paywall Surface (Settings → Go Premium / Transition moment → Continue)

The paywall is Atrest's **values surface** — the one place in the app where the ethical
foundation becomes visible to every user. It must embody the opposite of industry practice.

**Visual treatment:**
- Frosted glass over the dusk sky (same atmosphere as the rest of the app)
- Centered, spacious layout. No feature grid. No comparison table.
- The Atrest tree glyph at the top — not as decoration, but as identity.
- Earth palette typography. Unhurried. Generous line height.

**Content structure (top to bottom):**

1. **A single values statement.** Not a sales pitch. Not a feature list.
   Directional copy:
   > "Atrest was built with care — no urgency, no guilt, no tricks.
   > Supporting it means it stays that way."

2. **What premium includes** — described in experiential terms, not feature-gate terms:
   > "Keep the tree. Keep the forest. Keep your full history."
   
   NOT: "Unlock forest access, unlimited history, and tree visualization."

3. **The two price options** — presented equally (see Pricing section above).

4. **A restore purchases link** — standard, accessible, no-friction.

5. **Legal footer** — Terms, Privacy, renewal disclosure. Required by Apple.
   Tone: plain, honest, small but legible.

**What the paywall must NOT include:**
- Feature comparison tables (free vs premium)
- "Unlock" or "get access to" language
- Testimonials or social proof
- Star ratings or review counts
- Urgency of any kind
- A visual showing what the user is "missing"

---

## The "Go Premium" Entry Point (Post-Trial Free Users)

After the transition moment, the user can always find premium via:

- **Settings screen** — a quiet, single line: "Go premium" with a small arrow.
  Not a banner. Not a badge. Not a persistent notification dot. Just a text link
  in the settings list, styled the same as other settings items.

There is **no other premium prompt anywhere in the app**:
- No banner on the timer screen
- No badge on the forest/calendar icons (since these are hidden, not locked-and-teased)
- No periodic "reminder" modals
- No "you missed out on a tree" messaging after completing a fast as a free user

The user finds premium when they look for it. The app never pushes it.

---

## Post-Conversion Experience

When the user subscribes or purchases lifetime:

**Confirmation moment:**
- A brief, warm confirmation on the paywall surface itself:
  > "Welcome back to the full experience."
- The user is returned to their current screen. The tree/forest/calendar are now active.
- If the user has completed fasts during the free period, those fasts are
  retroactively reflected in the forest and calendar. Nothing is lost.
  This is important — the user's history is always stored, it's just the
  *display depth* that changes with premium.

**No "thank you for your purchase" modal.** No confetti. No celebration.
The app's way of thanking the user is to simply be what it was during the trial —
present, warm, and full.

---

## Cancellation and Expiry

If an annual subscription lapses:
- The user returns to the free tier. Immediately. No grace period messaging.
- The forest and full history become inaccessible (stored, not deleted).
- The tree stops materializing.
- No "your subscription has expired" banner. No re-subscribe nag.
- The "Go premium" link in Settings remains, same as it was before they first subscribed.
- If they re-subscribe, everything returns. All history, all forest trees. Nothing lost.

**The principle:** the app's behavior at every state transition — trial to free,
free to premium, premium to lapsed — must feel like the same calm, respectful companion.
No panic. No guilt. No urgency. The door is always open in both directions.

---

## Rules (Decision Checklist)

Any monetization feature must pass ALL of these:

1. ✅ Does the free user still have a dignified, atmospheric, functional fasting experience?
2. ✅ Is the free tier clearly "a product" rather than "a punishment"?
3. ✅ Is the premium value earned through genuine depth, not artificial withholding?
4. ✅ Is the transition moment warm, honest, and dismissible without friction?
5. ✅ Is the paywall surface free of urgency, scarcity, guilt, social proof, and comparison tables?
6. ✅ Does the app push premium exactly zero times after the single transition moment?
7. ✅ Are both price options presented with equal visual weight?
8. ✅ Would a user feel respected — not manipulated — at every step?
9. ✅ Would this survive a 1-star review that says "they tried to pressure me into paying"? (It should be impossible to write this review honestly.)
10. ✅ Does the mechanism align with the values statement on the paywall itself?
