# Milestone Doctrine

Only the following fasting phases may be referenced:

- 0–4 hours: Digestive completion
- 4–8 hours: Early metabolic shift
- 8–12 hours: Increasing metabolic flexibility
- 12–16 hours: Deeper fasting state
- 16+ hours: Extended fasting

No phase may be described as superior, optimal, or more valuable.
Longer fasting must never be implied as better.

Milestones arrive and pass without celebration.
