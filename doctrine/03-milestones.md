# Milestone Doctrine

## Purpose

Milestones orient the user within their fast.
They describe what is likely happening in the body — not what the user has achieved.
They are not rewards. They are not stages of a game. They are quiet markers.

## Fasting Phases

Each phase is defined by a biological transition, described in companion tone.
The descriptions below are **directional** — final UI copy will be refined,
but the register and factual grounding must be preserved.

### 0–4 hours: Digestion completing
The body is still processing the last meal.
Blood sugar and insulin are elevated, then gradually settling.
> Companion phrasing: "Your last meal is still being processed. Nothing has shifted yet."

### 4–8 hours: Beginning to shift
Insulin levels drop. The body begins transitioning from food-derived glucose
to glycogen stored in the liver.
> Companion phrasing: "Your body has finished digesting and is beginning to draw on its own reserves."

### 8–12 hours: Metabolic transition
Glycogen stores are being used. The body is between fuel sources —
this is often when people first feel the fast.
> Companion phrasing: "You may start to feel the fast more here. Your body is shifting between energy sources — a natural and temporary adjustment."

### 12–16 hours: Deeper fasting state
Glycogen is depleted or depleting. The body increasingly relies on fat oxidation.
Some cellular maintenance processes may be upregulated.
> Companion phrasing: "Your body has settled into a deeper rhythm, drawing more on stored energy. Some people feel clearer here; others feel the challenge more."

### 16–24 hours: Extended fasting
Fat oxidation is the primary fuel source. Autophagy-related processes
may be increasing, though timing varies significantly between individuals.
> Companion phrasing: "You are well into an extended fast. Your body is working with what it has. There is nothing to do but be here."

### 24+ hours: Prolonged fasting
The body has fully adapted to a fasted state.
Metabolic and cellular processes continue at their own pace.
> Companion phrasing: "This is a long fast. Your body has found its own pace. Be attentive to how you feel."

## Rules

- No phase may be described as superior, optimal, or more valuable than another.
- Longer fasting must never be implied as better or more worthwhile.
- Milestones arrive and pass without celebration or praise.
- The user is never told they have "achieved" a milestone — the milestone simply becomes the current description of where they are.
- Biological claims must use probabilistic language ("likely", "may", "typically") because bodies vary.
- Discomfort is acknowledged honestly, never dramatized and never minimized.
- The 24+ hour phase includes a gentle attentiveness prompt — the app does not encourage pushing beyond what feels right.
