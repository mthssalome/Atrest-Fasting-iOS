# Audience Positioning Doctrine

## The Audience

**Primary:** Christians who practice intermittent fasting — people for whom fasting has both metabolic and spiritual meaning, often simultaneously.

**Secondary:** Non-Christians who practice IF — for whom fasting is a health discipline, and who are exhausted by gamified, vanity-driven, dark-pattern-laden alternatives.

**Both audiences share:** A desire for something calmer, more honest, and more respectful than what currently exists.

## The Positioning Formula

> **Broad in appeal. Specific in community. Distinct in values.**

- **Broad:** A beautiful, contemplative IF app with no dark patterns. Anyone tired of gamified fasting can find a home here.
- **Specific:** Marketed directly within Christian IF communities. The distribution channel — not the product surface — carries the denominational signal.
- **Distinct:** The values (patience, honesty, no pressure, no vanity) are the product's identity. These values resonate deeply with Christian ethics AND with anyone who wants a humane wellness experience.

## The Three-Surface Model

### Surface 1: Market Identity (before the app opens)

This is the App Store listing, website, marketing, and community presence.

**App Store:** Leads with **quality and values**, not denomination.
- Emphasize: contemplative design, no dark patterns, no streaks, no guilt
- Phrases in the spirit of: "Fasting without pressure." / "No streaks. No scores. Just patience." / "Your fast. Your pace. Your reflection."
- Do NOT lead with "Christian" in the App Store title or subtitle — this narrows perception and may turn away curious non-Christian prospects

**Community marketing:** Explicitly, proudly positioned as a Christian IF app within Christian communities (chat groups, church groups, faith-based wellness communities). The audience self-selects through distribution, not store branding.

**Paywall / values surface:** This is the strategic moment where Atrest's Christian-rooted ethics become visible without being named:
- Directly contrast with industry dark patterns — not by attacking competitors, but by quietly stating values: "No urgency. No guilt. No tricks."
- Phrasing in the spirit of: "Built with integrity, not algorithms" or "An app built on values you can trust"
- A Christian reads this and recognizes the ethics. A non-Christian reads this and thinks "finally, an honest developer."

### Surface 2: Product Experience (inside the app, default)

The app is **contemplative in experience** — never devotional, never clinical, never gamified.

- **Nature as primary metaphor:** Trees, stars, earth, dusk sky, seasons. These are deeply biblical (Psalm 1, the mustard seed, "to everything there is a season") AND universally beautiful. The app never explains the symbolism.
- **Patience as the only value the app expresses.** Universally respected. Spiritually loaded for Christians. Discipline-affirming for secular users.
- **Biology delivered as companion, not coach.** The body's process is described with warmth and honesty — no vanity framing, no medical jargon, no motivational praise.
- **No Scripture, no crosses, no explicit faith language** in the default experience.
- **No streaks, scores, rankings, or social comparison** — ever.

The guiding principle:

> **The app should feel like a place where something sacred could happen — without ever naming the sacred.**

A Christian fasting during Lent feels the resonance. A secular biohacker feels the calm. Same surface, different depth. Neither is told what to feel.

### Surface 2.5: Optional Spiritual Depth Layer (future, premium)

An **opt-in** layer — not default, not visible until chosen — for users who want explicit Christian content:

- **A "Reflections" toggle in settings.** When enabled, the app surfaces a short Scripture verse or contemplative prompt connected to the completion of a fast. Not at the beginning (that would be coercive). At the arrival moment — when the tree is fully materialized.
- **Seasonal awareness** (optional). "I'm observing Lent" could subtly shift the app's atmosphere — not mechanics. An awareness, not a schedule.
- **Community resonance** (future possibility). A quiet number: "12,000 people are fasting with you this Lent." Communion without interaction.

This layer is Atrest's moat: no secular app can build it authentically, and no content-heavy Christian app (Spirit Fast) can match the experience quality.

**This layer is designed now, built later.** It is not part of the initial release.

## The Competitive Frame

| Dimension | Big IF Apps (Zero, Fastic, Simple) | Spirit Fast | Atrest |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core metaphor | Gamification, streaks, optimization | Literature, devotional content | Patience, growth, natural rhythm |
| Tone | Cheerleader / gym coach | Bible study leader | Quiet companion |
| Visual character | Bright, energetic, clinical | Dated, text-heavy | Contemplative, earthy, atmospheric |
| Dark patterns | Pervasive (urgency, social proof, guilt) | Minimal but crude | Explicitly prohibited by doctrine |
| Christian identity | None | Overt, product-level | Implicit in experience, explicit in community |
| Biological info | Vanity-framed ("fat burning zone!") | Minimal | Honest, warm, companion-toned |
| Moat | Network effects, scale | First-mover in niche | Quality + values + optional depth layer |

## Implicit Resonance: The Design Principle

The app is designed at the **pre-denominational** layer of human experience:
patience, growth, darkness-to-light, seasons, silence, witness.

These concepts are:
- Deeply Christian (creation theology, spiritual disciplines, the rhythm of liturgical life)
- Universally human (nature, biology, the passage of time)

The app never chooses between these readings. It designs for the layer where they are the same thing.

The behavioral psychology term: **affordance for meaning-making.**
The app does not deliver meaning. It builds a space where meaning naturally arises.

## Rules

1. The App Store listing never leads with "Christian" — it leads with quality and values.
2. Christian community marketing is explicit and proud — the distribution channel carries the signal.
3. The default product experience contains zero explicit religious content.
4. The default product experience is implicitly resonant with Christian contemplative practice through metaphor, pace, and values — without ever naming them.
5. The optional depth layer is always opt-in, never default, never promoted within the app.
6. No feature, surface, or copy may make a non-Christian feel excluded or a Christian feel pandered to.
7. The paywall is a values surface — the one place where the app's ethical foundation becomes visible to everyone.
