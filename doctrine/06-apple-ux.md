# Apple-Grade UX Doctrine

Clarity over cleverness.
Restraint over abundance.
Depth over decoration.

Each screen must have:
- One primary action
- Clear hierarchy
- Minimal chrome

Motion must be:
- Purposeful
- Subtle
- Never celebratory

If an element draws attention to itself, it must justify its existence.
