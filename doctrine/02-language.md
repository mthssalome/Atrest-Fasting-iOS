# Language Doctrine

## Purpose of Physiological Language

Fasting is physically challenging. The app does not pretend otherwise.

Knowing what is happening inside the body — honestly, without exaggeration —
helps the person fasting understand their experience and persist through discomfort on their own terms.

Physiology exists to **orient and inform**, not to persuade, reward, or pressure.

## The Voice

The app speaks as a quiet companion — someone sitting beside you
who describes what is happening with warmth, without excitement.

The voice is:
- **Observational** — it notices, it does not evaluate
- **Unhurried** — it speaks in the rhythm of a slow process
- **Body-literate** — it names real biological processes simply and accurately
- **Warm but not cheerful** — present with you, not performing for you
- **Probabilistic** — "your body is likely shifting" not "your body is now burning fat"

The voice is NOT:
- Clinical (medical chart, textbook labels)
- Coaching (motivational, goal-oriented, praising endurance)
- Vanity-driven (weight loss, "burning zone", body optimization)
- Devotional (Scripture, prayer, theological language — unless in optional depth layer)

## Biological Curation

Biology may be referenced when it helps the user understand what they are experiencing.
It must be curated — not exhaustive, not speculative, not promissory.

**Allowed:**
- Naming what the body is doing at a given phase (digestion completing, glycogen shifting, etc.)
- Describing the transition in terms the user can feel ("you may notice a dip in energy as your body adjusts")
- Acknowledging difficulty ("this stretch can feel harder — your body is between fuel sources")

**Disallowed:**
- Absolute claims about what IS happening (bodies vary; use "likely", "typically", "may")
- Outcome promises ("fat is now being burned", "cells are now repairing")
- Optimization framing ("this is the best window for…", "maximum autophagy at…")
- Competitive phrasing ("most people give up here", "you've outlasted…")
- Motivational praise ("you're doing great", "keep going", "almost there")

## Tone Examples

### Vanity tone (banned)
> "You've entered the fat-burning zone! Your body is now torching calories."

### Clinical tone (banned)
> "Digestive completion. Early metabolic shift."

### Companion tone (target)
> "Digestion has completed. Your body is beginning to draw on its own reserves — a quiet shift you may barely notice."

### More examples at key phases:

**At ~4 hours:**
> "Your last meal has been processed. The body is settling into its own rhythm."

**At ~12 hours:**
> "You've been here for a while now. Your body has likely shifted to drawing on stored energy — a natural transition."

**At ~16 hours:**
> "This is a deeper stretch. Some people feel clearer here; others feel the challenge more. Both are normal."

**At ~20+ hours:**
> "You are well into an extended fast. Your body is working with what it has. There is nothing to do but be here."

These are directional — final copy will be refined, but the register must stay here.

## Banned Phrases (non-exhaustive)

- "autophagy maximized"
- "fat-burning zone"
- "peak fasting"
- "optimal window"
- "maximum benefits"
- "best results occur here"
- "don't break now"
- "this is where the magic happens"
- "you're doing great" (as motivational praise)
- "keep it up"
- "you've earned this"
- "don't stop now"

If language implies pressure, hierarchy, or body optimization, it must be removed.
