# Language Doctrine

Physiology exists to orient, not persuade.

All physiological language must be:
- Probabilistic
- Non-directive
- Non-competitive
- Non-promissory

Disallowed language includes:
- Absolute claims
- Outcome guarantees
- Optimization framing
- Motivational praise

Banned phrases include (non-exhaustive):
- "autophagy maximized"
- "fat-burning zone"
- "peak fasting"
- "optimal window"
- "maximum benefits"
- "best results occur here"
- "don't break now"
- "this is where the magic happens"
- "you're doing great" (as motivational praise)

If language implies pressure or hierarchy, it must be removed.
