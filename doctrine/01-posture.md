# Posture Doctrine

The application is a witness, not a judge.

It accompanies the user without evaluating, pressuring, or rewarding behavior.
The app must never imply moral, personal, or physiological superiority.

Discomfort is acknowledged, not valorized.
Stopping is always permitted.
Returning is always welcomed.

Any feature that evaluates, ranks, pressures, or coerces violates this posture.
