# Posture Doctrine

## What Atrest Is

Atrest is a space, not a system.

It does not optimize the user.
It does not coach, motivate, or evaluate.
It holds a quiet place and stays in it —
ready whenever the user arrives, unchanged by how long they were gone.

The posture is that of a still room:
present, warm, without demand.

## What the App Witnesses

The app witnesses the user's presence — not their performance.

It does not know if a fast was easy or hard.
It does not know if the user is struggling or thriving.
It records what happened and holds it, without commentary.

This is not indifference. It is respect.

## On Discomfort

Fasting involves discomfort. The app acknowledges this without dramatizing it.

Discomfort is not valorized — it is not made to feel noble or worthy.
But it is not minimized either.

The app simply remains: steady, unhurried, and available.

## On Stopping

Stopping is always permitted.
Abandoning a fast carries no penalty, no language of failure, no prompting to reconsider.
The app opens the door without comment.

Returning is always welcomed.
There is no streak to rebuild, no progress to recover.
The next fast begins the same way the first one did.

## The Line That Must Not Be Crossed

Any feature that does any of the following violates this doctrine:

- Evaluates the user's choices
- Ranks one behavior above another
- Creates pressure to continue, return, or perform
- Implies that more fasting equals more worth
- Punishes absence
- Celebrates presence in a way that implies absence is lesser

Beautiful design does not exempt a feature from this test.
A beautiful pressure mechanism is still a pressure mechanism.
