# Tree & Forest Doctrine

## What a Tree Is

A tree is a silent offering.

It is what remains after a fast — not a trophy, not a reward,
but a presence. Something that grew from the user's stillness
and now lives in the world, quietly, permanently.

The user does not earn a tree. They create the conditions for one.
The tree arrives the way dawn arrives: without announcement.

---

## What the Forest Is

The forest is accumulated memory.
It is not a record of performance. It is a record of presence.

Looking at the forest, the user should feel:
*I have been here many times. This place is mine.*

Not: *I have done well. I should do more.*

## Visual Character of Trees

Each tree must feel like a real thing, not a schematic.
A tree is not a circle on a capsule. A tree has:
- A silhouette drawn with character — slightly asymmetric, organic
- A tonal identity seeded by the session's start time or duration
  (so no two trees are identical, though none is superior)
- A root, a canopy, a presence on the ground

Trees may vary in:
- Tonal warmth (amber, grey-green, cool mist, deep bark)
- Silhouette shape (within a defined family of forms)
- Subtle texture

Trees must not vary in:
- Size (implying duration = worth)
- Brightness (implying longer = better)

## The Tree During a Fast

While a fast is active, the tree for that session is present on the timer screen
in a state of becoming — not a ghost, but not yet complete.
It begins faint and progressively materializes over the duration of the fast.
Each time the user returns to the timer screen, the tree is more present than before.
This is not a progress bar. It is presence accumulating.

### How Materialization Works

The tree has two properties that evolve simultaneously:

- **Opacity** — begins at ~5% at fast start, reaches 100% at completion
- **Color temperature** — begins cool near-grey at fast start, warms to the
  tree's full earthy tonal identity at completion

Neither axis communicates a percentage. Together they say: *the light is finding it.*

The underlying truth: the tree was always going to exist.
The fast is the act of allowing it to become visible —
like a long-exposure photograph resolving in a darkroom.
The user is not building it. They are revealing it.

Technically: both values are computed from `elapsed / targetDuration`
each time the timer screen renders. No continuous background animation.
The tree simply appears at whatever state the math produces.
Each morning it is slightly more itself than the day before.

When the fast completes, the tree reaches full presence on the timer screen.
At that moment — before any transition to the forest — a star appears
at the top right of the tree. Quiet, unhurried. A 4-pointed light,
as if the sky just noticed.

This is the first appearance of the star. It belongs to the timer screen
and to that tree. Only after this beat does the tree move into the forest,
carrying its star into the sky above the grove.

## Incomplete Fasts

If a user ends a fast having completed at least 70% of the target duration,
the tree enters the forest permanently.

An incomplete tree:
- Renders at reduced opacity (~30%) — present, but clearly distinct from completed trees
- Retains its cool grey tone — it never received the warmth it was moving toward
- Carries no star — neither on the timer screen nor in the sky
- Ages with the same atmospheric depth rules as all other trees
- Is never marked, labeled, or distinguished by any UI text

An incomplete fast below 70% leaves no trace in the forest.

Incompleteness is not failure. It is an honest record of a real attempt.
The grey tree is not a wound. It is simply a tree that the light did not fully reach.

## The Sky

The forest exists under a perpetual dusk sky — the liminal hour,
the threshold between day and night, between fasting and eating.
This is not a time-of-day simulation. It is a fixed emotional register.

The background hue drifts slowly within a dusk-to-deep-night range:
- Warm amber at one end
- Deep indigo at the other
The drift is imperceptible in real-time, noticeable across sessions.

The sky carries its own layer: stars.
Every completed fast places one star in the sky above the forest.
Stars are positioned independently of trees — they are not anchored
to or above their corresponding tree. The celestial and the earthly
occupy the same space without being mechanically tethered.

Star form: a 4-pointed light — the classic compass form — with a
subtle radial glow. Not a 5-pointed achievement star. Something
you might see in the sky, not on a scoreboard.

Star placement: seeded by session ID, distributed across the full
canvas width and the upper 40% of viewport height.

Star depth: older stars recede with the same atmospheric logic as
older trees — still present, still real, but quieter. All stars
always render; none are culled. The forest has a sky of depth.

Parallax: as the user scrolls through the grove, the sky drifts
slower than the trees. The constellation moves as a ceiling moves —
registering the scroll without being governed by it.

The user cannot point to a star and say *that one is mine for that fast.*
But they know the stars are there because they were.

---

## Visual Lifecycle of the Forest

Older trees age into atmosphere.
They do not disappear — they recede, like old photographs developing further,
like distant trees in morning mist.

A recently completed fast appears with full tonal presence.
A fast from months ago is still visible, still real,
but quieter — as memory quiets without erasing.

This is not a reward mechanic. It is time made visible.

---

## The Moment of Arrival

When a fast completes and a tree is created,
there must be a moment — slow, unhurried, beautiful —
where the tree arrives fully in the forest.

This is the signature moment of the entire application.
It must feel like something sacred happened quietly.
No fanfare. No confetti. No praise.
The tree completing. Then, last of all, a star appearing in the sky above —
not above the tree specifically, but somewhere in the sky that is now
slightly more full than it was before.

The star fades in last — after the tree has fully materialized.
A door opening, not a party beginning.

This transition is the most important animation in the app.
It must be designed last, when everything else is settled,
and it must be designed with the most care.

## What the Forest Must Not Become

- A leaderboard of any kind
- A density display (more trees = visible progress)
- A motivational device ("keep building your forest")
- A count display
- A comparison surface

The forest is a garden held in private.
It belongs only to the person who made it.
