# Tree & Forest Doctrine

A tree represents a single fasting session.
A forest represents accumulated memory.

Trees must not:
- Grow larger
- Become more beautiful
- Signal achievement

The forest must not:
- Display counts
- Display density rewards
- Imply completion or progress

Older trees may fade into atmosphere but must remain visible.
Nothing is ever erased.
